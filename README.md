# YASARA Plugin cookiecutter

A cookiecutter template to kickstart [YASARA](http://www.yasara.org/) plugin development.

It creates the basic structure of a YASARA Python plugin, complete with:

* Install / uninstall scripts for Linux and Windows 
* A basic documentation layout for your plugin using Sphinx.

The code generated by this cookiecutter template is **installable** to YASARA out of the box and 
completely functional, enabling you to focus on writing the business logic of the plugin itself.


## Requirements

To use this template, make sure that you have a Python environment with cookiecutter installed.

```
    > pip install cookiecutter
```

For more details about cookiecutter please see [here](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).


## Usage

To create the plugin scaffold, simply run cookiecutter, grabbing the latest release from this repository:


```
    > cookiecutter https://github.com/aanastasiou/yapltemp/releases/latest/download/yapltemp.zip
```

Or, similarly, if you have git installed:

```
    > cookiecutter https://github.com/aanastasiou/yapltemp.git
```

Cookiecutter will then ask you a number of questions to customise your plugin template and generate 
the initial scaffold.
